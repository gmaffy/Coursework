deCodon was a program created for a class challenge to decode various quotes embedded in the genome of a synthetic bacterium created by the J Craig Venter Institute.
The code is described here: http://singularityhub.com/2010/05/24/venters-newest-synthetic-bacteria-has-secret-messages-coded-in-its-dna/

Note that since this was a speed challenge (I won a t-shirt for cracking it first!), the code is messy and somewhat inefficient.

Child folder "Final Project" contains a genetic algorithm that I implemented based on pseudocode description from Melanie Mitchell's book "Complexity". See readme file in that child folder for more detail.
