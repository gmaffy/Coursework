Project 1: functions for calculating the degree distribution of a graph represented as a dict()
v1 was the original build. v2 adds some extra functions that are useful in the Application

Application 1 is code to load a directed graph that represents citations in physics papers. Using this code to load the graph,
I then used the Project 1 v2 code to analyze the data and found that it followed a power distribution. A randomly-connected graph
follows a normal distribution, but a graph with power-distributed connectivity can be created using the DPA algorithm in v2.

Application1 is a png image of the final submitted work for this week of the course, showing the output from all of the previous files.
